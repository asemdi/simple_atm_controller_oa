# Simple ATM Controller

You can clone this project with **git clone https://github.com/asemdi/simple_atm_controller_oa.git**

### Details
* **atm.py** - contains the main ContainerATM class and helper Bank class (though out of the scope of the task, I decided to implement it for easier testing)
* **test.py** - contains pre-written tests for atm.py
* **runATM.py** - run this file if you wish to test the ATM in a simple simulator yourself. There is an existing user with card number 1234 and pin 1.

To run a file, run:
python3 [name_of_the_file]
